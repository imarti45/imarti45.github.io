       <p>The San Francisco Giants originally named the New York Gothams in 1883, later renamed the New York Giants in 1886 in NY and the historical Polo Ground Stadium until they were relocated to San Francisco in 1958.
           The G-men played at Seal Stadium for one season, then played at Candlestick for 40 years until they moved to what is now called Oracle Park in the heart of San Francisco. Over nearly 140 years of very rich 
           history in which the Giants have won 8 World Series(World Championships), 3 coming from the San Francisco Giants. The Giants also have a collection of All-Time talent, players like Willie Mays and Barry Bonds,
           who make solid arguments as the greatest BASEBALL players of all time.

           The SFG 2021 season has been great for the Giants as they have eclipsed expectations by a longshot. They were expected to be a 3rd to 5th place team.
           But instead they are the best team in baseball by a few games with the playoffs approcahing in a few weeks.  
           They are being led by Buster Posey, Brandon Crawford, Kris Bryant, Logan Webb amongst a roster full of winners.
           The Giants have a real shot at winning the World Series. But it will come with a lot of <bold style="color: orange;">TORTURE.</bold>
