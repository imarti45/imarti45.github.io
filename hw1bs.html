       <p>The Golden State Warriors originally the Philadelphia Warriors were founded in 1946. They were later relocated and renamed the San Francisco Warriors from 1962 - 1971.
           After about 10 seasons claiming only San Francisco, in 1971 the Warriors relocated and changed name to Golden State Warriors because they were playing most of their games in Oakland at Oracle arena, but name Golden State also comes
           from the fact that the Warriors even played 6 home games in San Diego. Thankfully however thr Warriors never moved permanetly to SD. The Warriors history isn't as great and they don't have the long list of prolific names
           like the Giants and 49ers do. But with names like Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry, and having the latest Bay Area Sports Dynasty by going to 5 consecutive championships and winning 3 of them. In 2020, Warriors relocated back to San Francisco in the Chase Center but keeping the name "Golden State".

           
       </p>
       <p>the 2021 is set to kick off in a few months and the Warriors are primed to go back to the playoffs and depending on the status of Klay Thompson and the development of the younger players (Johnathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, & James Wiseman). </p>
