            <h3>#1 Image optimization and Compression</h3> 
            
            <p>To save some time and not have a slower page, compressing your files and images may go a long way. For the image I used in assignment 1, the website I used was <a href="https://compresspng.com/" target="_blank">Compresspng.com</a>. It helped compress and optimize a pretty medium sized png photo by 67%. Meaning the height and with of new photo is two thirds less big and cluttered. </p>
            <h3>#2 Grids</h3>
            
            <p>the use of grid-template-areas and grid-areas, are huge reasons why my layouts will continue to get better, and cleared up a prior fear of grids.</p>


            <h3>#3 caniuse.com</h3>

            <p> before this class, I used to use a lot of obsolete tags, but <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a>.com  allows you to keep up with tags and make sure they are compatable with different browsers.</p>
