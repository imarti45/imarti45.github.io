                        <p>I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan</p>
                        <p>This quote gives me perspective into falling in love with art of FAILING. especially with coding, You have to be ok with mishaps but still having the mental capacity of believing your are still capable of success </p>
