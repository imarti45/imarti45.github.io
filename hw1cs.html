       <p>The San Francisco 49ers were founded in in 1944, they are named after the miners during the San Francisco / Sacramento Gold rush.
           The 49ers played their first game at Kezar Stadium in 1946 and played there until 1970, where they moved to Candlestck Park. Candlestick park 
           is where the 49ers became a staple to the NFL by winning 5 Super Bowls, while showing the world some of the greatest players the game of football
           has ever seen(Jerry Rice and Joe Montana). In 2014, the 49ers moved from San Francisco to Santa Clara and now play at Levi's stadium. 

           
       </p>
       <p>As the 2021 season kicks off, the 49ers look to bounce back after an injury riddled year in 2020 and try to return to the playoffs. 2021 is off the rough start at key players are already lost for the year, but the 49ers
           are still in position to make a fun run in the playoffs.
