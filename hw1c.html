        <h3>#1 Image optimization and Compression</h3>
        <p>To save some time and not have a slower page, compressing your files and images may go a long way. For the image I used in assignment 1, the website I used was <a href = "https://compresspng.com/"
            target="_blank">Compresspng.com</a>. It helped compress and optimize a pretty medium sized png photo by 67%. Meaning the height and with of new photo is two thirds less big and cluttered.
